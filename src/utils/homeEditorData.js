            text: 'Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a term that refers to the ease with which a machine can perform tasks that would normally be performed by humans. Machine Learning (ML) technology is a subset of AI that began in 1949 with the concept of "machine learning" developed by Arthur Samuel. ML is based on building computers that learn on their own without having to be explicitly programmed to create models from, for example, data from specialized applications.  Machine Learning is based on the design of computer systems that learn automatically in order to improve their performance progressively without the need to be explicitly programmed. ML algorithms seek to find patterns using the data, in order to make relevant predictions. This process takes place through different learning algorithms and combines pattern recognition techniques based on statistics and logic.  Simply put, Machine Learning is a combination of computational techniques and tools that allow our computer systems to learn on their own from data, rather than being programmed to achieve a specific result. This technology has become a key tool for solving complex problems and providing truly innovative solutions in thousands of different fields',
